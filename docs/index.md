# Welcome to Your Project Docs

This is a demo documentation site powered by MkDocs and GitHub Pages.

- Edit this file to update your homepage.
- Add more Markdown files in the docs/ folder for more pages.

## Next Steps
- We’ll set up MkDocs to build this into a website.
- Then we’ll automate deployment to GitHub Pages!
